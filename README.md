# Sequence
Check readme file

Input:
  User enters a positive number
  
Runtime:
  To get the next number in the sequence we do the following: If the integer is odd,
  we multiply by 3 and add 1. If the integer is even, we divide by 2.
  It is hypothesized that the above sequence will always converge to the value of 1,
  regardless of any valid initial choice. This hypothesis is known as the Collatz Conjecture.
  
Output:
  Prints out how many steps it took to get to 1
  Prints out the largest number that occured during the Collatz Conjecture and at which step it occured
  Prints out the second largest number in the the Collatz Conjecture and at which step it occured
